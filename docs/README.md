# PySort

PySort is a comprehensive Python package that offers easy access to various sorting algorithms. It is designed for educational purposes and can also be used in projects requiring sorting functionality. PySort includes implementations of the most common sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, and Radix Sort.

## Features

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time, making it more suitable for small data sets.
- **Merge Sort**: An efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
- **Quick Sort**: An efficient sorting algorithm using a divide and conquer approach, which picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.
- **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the beginning.
- **Radix Sort**: A non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits.

## Installation

You can install PySort via pip. If the package is available on PyPI, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install PySort
