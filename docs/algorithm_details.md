# Algorithm Details

This document provides a brief explanation of each sorting algorithm included in the package.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## Merge Sort

Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, meaning that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output.

## Quick Sort

Quick Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of a random access file or an array in order. Developed by Tony Hoare in 1959, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting.

## Selection Sort

Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n^2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.

## Radix Sort

Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix. For elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered.
